# Bash SpeedSheet

The Bash speedsheet covers scripting and programming for Bash. It does not include unix command line commands. See the Unix speedsheet for that.. The speedsheet is hosted on [speedsheet.io](https://speedsheet.io). This is the raw content for that speedsheet.

# Status

Content: Reasonably Complete, But A Bit Disorganized

There is a lot of content in here. Most of the basics are covered including many useful tips and tricks. It does need some love in the editing and organizing department though.

We love speedsheets and we'd love to have them for every language and library out there. But we don't have remotely enough time for all the great docs we want to create. If you would like to help, you can submit updates right here. It would be greatly appreciated! 

And thanks!
